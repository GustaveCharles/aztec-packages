Notes are the underlying data structure of every piece of information in the Aztec network. You can learn more about them [here](../../../../aztec/concepts/state_model/index.md)

In Aztec.nr, notes can represent data structures such as:

- Address
- Value

You can also write your own custom note for any other piece of data.
